## 🧠 Problem Solved

Many hospitals and clinics still use manual methods or inefficient tools for scheduling appointments, which leads to:
- ❌ Overlapping appointments
- 📞 Tedious manual booking
- 🕒 Time wasted by staff and patients

✅ **This system streamlines the booking process**, allowing users to:
- Book in real-time
- View doctor availability instantly
- Receive appointment confirmations on-screen

> If this system were used in a real hospital, it could **save 10–20 hours per week** in manual scheduling tasks and reduce no-shows by giving better visibility.
